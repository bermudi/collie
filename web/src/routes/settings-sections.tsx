// ── THE FOUR SETTINGS SECTIONS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Settings was one column of seventeen cards, and the file said so: "Settings is a flat stack of
// cards and has no headings at all; introducing the first one here would imply four more." It
// implied four more. On a phone the stack was over a thousand pixels of scroll with nothing to
// skim by, so a person looking for one switch had to read every card to find it.
//
// It is an index of four rows now, each opening one of these. Each page is short enough to take in
// at once, which is the whole reason for the split: not fewer settings, fewer at a time.
//
// ── WHY FOUR FILES' WORTH OF ROUTES LIVE IN ONE ──────────────────────────────
// Every other route in this directory is its own file because every other route has behaviour.
// These four have none: each is an ordered list of cards that already exist, and the order IS the
// design. Four files of eight lines each would hide four one-line decisions in four places. The
// order within each page is commented where it is not obvious; the split between pages is
// commented once, here.
//
// ── THE SPLIT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Appearance — how this phone PRESENTS itself. Anything you would change to make the app look
//              different, including what the mirror renders with.
// Device     — how this phone TREATS you. Feedback, input, and what the pane menu is allowed to
//              offer. Nothing here changes a pixel until you do something.
// Alerts     — when Collie speaks up, on this device and bridge-wide.
// System     — what this thing is talking to, and whether it is well. Diagnostics and access.
//
// The line that took the most argument is Changes (`ChangesControl`): it decides how a pane's
// Changes view FINDS repos, which sounds like appearance and is not. It is read by the pane menu
// and it changes what a request asks the bridge for, so it sits in Device beside zen's
// availability — both are standing decisions about what this phone may do, not about how it looks.
