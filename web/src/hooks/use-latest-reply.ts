// Keeps the pane view holding the agent's newest spoken turn, read from its own session log.
//
// The pane route CANNOT get this from the mirror: an agent's TUI runs on the alternate screen, so
// `pane.read` returns the viewport and nothing above it (see lib/latest-reply.ts for the full why).
// The journal is a second source with a different cost, which is what this hook is really managing.
//
// WHEN IT FETCHES. Not on the poll. The mirror revalidates every ~1.5 s and a fetch here re-parses the
// agent's log bridge-side whenever its mtime moved (bridge/journal caches on size+mtime), so fetching
// per poll would put a whole-journal parse on a loop. Instead it waits for the mirror text to SETTLE —
// unchanged for SETTLE_MS — which a streaming reply never does. In practice that is one fetch per
// finished message, the same cost as opening the history route once, which is what this replaces.
//
// The first fetch is immediate rather than settle-delayed: opening a pane whose reply is already
// clipped should show it, not make you wait out a timer for output that may never change again.
