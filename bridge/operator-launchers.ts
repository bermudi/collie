// The operator's own launcher rows, read from `launchers.toml` next to their `.env` — the exact
// sibling of `commands.toml` and `keys.toml`, down to the discovery rule and the mtime-checked live
// reload (operator-file.ts owns both).
//
// A file rather than an env var for the same reason `commands.toml` gives: `.env` is dual-parsed
// (bash sources it, systemd reads it as an EnvironmentFile) and the quoting the two readers want
// differs, and a list packed into one variable has to spend separators a value then cannot contain.
// A shell line — `command = "make -C ~/dev/collie test"` — is exactly the kind of prose that would
// be wounded by that. TOML gives every field its own key, so a command may contain any character
// except the control characters the shell would interpret as a second line.
//
// Why the configured list doubles as the allowlist `POST /api/launch` matches against: the client
// names a row, it never supplies a command line. The `command` string is an identity looked up by
// exact equality, not a free-text argument the bridge interpolates. That is the whole security story
// of the route — a phone outside the tailnet cannot invent a command the operator never wrote. The
// bridge never builds a shell line from client input; it only re-types a line the operator already
// reviewed in their own file.
//
// Why a control character in `command` drops the row: the string is typed into a herdr pane
// verbatim via `pane.send_text` and a newline (or any ASCII control) would submit a second line the
// operator never reviewed. The row is not sanitised; it is rejected. A pane is a real terminal, so
// silently stripping the character would change what runs without saying so — the narrow failure
// (drop the row, warn once) is the only one that cannot be mistaken for a successful launch of the
// operator's intended command.

/**
 * Turn a parsed TOML document into launcher rows, dropping anything malformed with one warning line.
 *
 * Pure and total: it never throws and never reads a file, so the grammar is unit-testable without
 * fs. Every rejection is a DROP of the offending row, never of the file — one typo'd row must not
 * cost the operator the rest of their launch strip.
 *
 * ```toml
 * [[launchers]]
 * command = "rumen-peek"        # required; the shell line, typed verbatim
 * label = "Runs & quota"        # optional; defaults to the command's first whitespace-separated token
 * cwd = "~/dev/collie"          # optional; defaults to the operator's home dir, leading ~ expanded
 * ```
 *
 * A later row for the same `command` replaces the earlier one IN PLACE, so correcting a row does
 * not reshuffle the dashboard.
